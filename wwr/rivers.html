              <div class="rivername"> Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho </div>
              <div class="text">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near 
                it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty 
                of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river 
                and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe 
                inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                from sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The 
                Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river 
                the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in 
                the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to 
                swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</div>

              <div class="rivername"> Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah </div>
              <div class="text">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land 
                anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
                cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip
                 runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts 
                 outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic 
                 human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and 
                 is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                 This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</div>

              <div class="rivername"> Grand Canyon, Arizona </div>
              <div class="text">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
                You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting combines 
                world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river 
                experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side 
                canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses 
                a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
                accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are 
                familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</div>
